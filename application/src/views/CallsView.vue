            <p>
              The 10th Latin American Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (CLIHC 2023), aims to provide a premier
              forum that brings together the Latin American and international Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research
              communities to discuss and share ideas, methods, approaches, and techniques for designing, implementing, and
              evaluating interactive user experiences. In accordance with previous editions, we believe that HCI must
              foster the production of technology that can be used by and benefit as many people as possible, enabling
              intercultural exchange and cooperation between people with different backgrounds and needs.
            </p>
