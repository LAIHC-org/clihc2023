He is currently a Senior Lecturer of Learning Analytics and Human-Computer Interaction with the Faculty of Information Technology and Coordinator of the Centre for Learning Analytics with Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. He is a co-author of numerous research papers. He is the first Australian/Mexican to win the Swiss-based Jacobs Foundation Research Fellowship (2021\u201323) for his pioneering research in Human-Centred AI in Education. His research focuses on advancing the understanding of socio-technical issues around the use of artificial intelligence in education, promoting the use of human-centred methodologies to create learning analytics interfaces with integrity and enhancing authentic learning spaces with multimodal data-intensive computing capabilities. He has been Program Chair of the International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge and the International Conference of Artificial Intelligence in Education, and he is a regular Associate Chair of the Learning and Education subcommittee of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. He is Associate Editor of the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education.

In 2021, she earned her PhD degree in Human-Centered Computing from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, United States, and in 2011, she earned a master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Indiana University, Bloomington. Marisol investigates how theories from the social, cultural, and learning sciences can inform strengths-based co-design of technologies with vulnerable groups such as immigrant families. Contrary to the traditional approach of designing for needs, which tries to correct the deficits of vulnerable populations, the strengths-based design that Marisol explores seeks to recognize, take advantage of, and enhance their knowledge and capabilities. Marisol has been a Fulbright scholar and a Schlumberger Faculty for the Future scholarship recipient. She is also a member of the Latin American Committee of the ACM SIGCHI, is a regular Associate Chair of the Critical Computing subcommittee for CHI, an associate editor for the ACM Journal on Computing and Sustainable Societies, Conference Chair of CLIHC 2023, and Paper Chair of CSCW 2024.

For many years, he has been involved in research projects in the area of Command and Control Systems in multiple domains, including drones, multimodal interfaces for military cockpits, ground segment systems in satellite control rooms, Air Traffic Control workstations, Flight safety for launchpads, and more. In civil aviation, he worked on the specification and certification issues of new interactive cockpits (that have to be compliant with the ARINC 661 specification standard) of large airplanes such as the Airbus A350, with a recent focus on multi-touch interactions. In all these domains, the joint modeling of the interactive system behavior and user tasks was a key aspect to assess and ensure compatibility between operators\u2019 work and the tools provided to them to perform this work. He has edited and co-edited more than twenty books or conference proceedings and co-authored more than 200 refereed publications in international conferences and journals. He is a member of ACM SIGCHI CHI Academy and chair of the IFIP Technical Assembly.
