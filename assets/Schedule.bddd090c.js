The emphasis on positioning strengths rather than needs at the center of the process can complicate designers' decisions on what activities to foster, how to conduct them, and what outcomes to expect. In this talk, I reflect on my journey trying to apply an assets-based approach to design when working first with Latin* parents in the U.S. to reinvent technologies for parents to engage with their children\u2019s education, then working with different communities in Guayaquil who are seeking in technology a way to innovate and sustain their work, and finally, with other Latin American HCI researchers who are trying to render visible the strengths that the region brings to HCI as a globalized discipline. In particular, I explore the problems and implications of focusing on assets as the base for design, propose capacity-focused design as a more realistic alternative than assets-based design, and discuss the methodological commitments and changes of perspective around work, technology's role, and transformation that this approach requires.

In education, a surge of new tools has been launched in a remarkably short time, challenging conventional assessment practices and reshaping how students demonstrate their knowledge creation. Yet, in the rush to embrace the future, it's crucial to keep human factors at the core of these efforts. This keynote will explore the significance of a human-centered design approach in integrating AI in education. A human-centered approach to designing AI innovations not only holds the potential to enhance learning outcomes but also to acknowledge, respect, and design for the unique attributes of human cognition and emotion. This undertaking is a multi-disciplinary effort, seamlessly weaving together foundations of Human-Computer Interaction, design, educational theory, and data science. I will present an authentic case study that illustrates the profound impact of blending human expertise with machine intelligence. This study revolves around a multimodal learning analytics project where educators and other educational stakeholders collaboratively designed a data capture infrastructure to support face-to-face collaboration. In this project, multiple sensors\u2014including positioning sensors, physiological wristbands, audio devices, and video\u2014were utilized to monitor groups of nursing students. The primary aim was to co-design interfaces that amplify reflective practices and explore how AI can be used to support education with integrity.
