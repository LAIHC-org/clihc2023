The tutorials and workshops empower attendees to learn new skills and offer possibilities to meet new people and discuss topics of shared interest. The scope for tutorials and workshops is broad and includes topics, such as new technologies, research approaches and methodologies, design practices, user/consumer insights, investigations into new services/applications/interfaces, statistics, and much more. Virtual or Augmented Reality, wearable computing, and generally applications with technology on the go in mind are highly recommended. </p><p> A tutorial and workshop should focus on its topic in detail and include references to the &quot;must-read&quot; papers or materials within its domain. A participatory approach in which the tutorial participants actively engage in exercises is welcomed, though not required. The expected audience will vary in terms of prior knowledge, but will largely consist of researchers, PhD students, practitioners, and educators. Tutorial and workshop proposal submissions by members of the industry are welcomed as well. </p><p> The overall conference theme in 2023 is Culture and Artificial Intelligence, so we invite tutorials and workshop to discuss ethical aspects in their work, as part of their problem definitions, system design, experiment design, instrument and metric adoption and conclusions. </p><h3 id="cwt-dates">Important Dates</h3><ul><li>Submission deadline: <del>July 31st</del> August 11th EXTENDED</li><li>Notification: August 28th</li><li>Camera ready: September 14th</li><li>Event Oct 30 - 31, Nov 1</li></ul><h3>Submission Platform</h3><p> All materials must be submitted electronically to the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=clihc2023" class="uline">EasyChair Conference System</a>, to the Workshop and Tutorials\u2019 track, by the deadline. </p><h3>Submission Format and Length</h3><ul><li> Submission format to be used for each category will follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" class="uline">new ACM Master Article format</a>.
